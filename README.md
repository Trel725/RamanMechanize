# RamanMechanize

A project for adding automation functionality for the industrial Raman microscope.  
Basically, it is nothing more than a GUI for a microcontroller running GRBL software
with additional communication with microscope native software (using pywinauto).
Project is written in a probably completely unportable manner, so no extra details is provided.  
E-mailing is welcomed in case of any interest.
